# endlessminigamepackage
An endless mini game package that contains basic managers and scenes. <br>
The creation purpose of this package was getting the MVP as fast as possible for testing. After the basic mechanics are implemented in your game, you can import this package and have all required UI for the MVP. <br>

# How to use
It contains a global game state manager class which is responsible for the game state management. It invokes delegate functions like OnGameStart, OnGamePaused and in your classes you need to add your method to them. Also it contains necessary scenes like Start Scene, Pause Scene, End Game Scene etc. and they are fully customizable. <br>
You need to drag&drop the prefab to your core scene. A start scene will be added when you run the game, on top of that scene. <br>
<br>
Maybe one I day I edit this package and write more detailed documentation. <br>
