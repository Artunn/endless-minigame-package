# endlessminigamepackage
an endless mini game package that contains basic managers and scenes
the purpose was setting the MVP as fast as possible. After the basic mechanics are implemented, you can import the package and have all required UI etc. for MVP.

contains a global game state manager class which is responsible for the game state management like start stop, and appropriate scenes like start scene, pause scene etc.
you need to drag&drop the prefab to your basic scene.
maybe one I day I edit this package a little more and have more detailed documentation but for now I believe in you :)
