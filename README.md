# endlessminigamepackage
an endless mini game package that contains basic managers and scenes <br>
the purpose was setting the MVP as fast as possible. After the basic mechanics are implemented, you can import the package and have all required UI etc. for MVP. <br>

contains a global game state manager class which is responsible for the game state management like start stop, and appropriate scenes like start scene, pause scene etc. <br>
you need to drag&drop the prefab to your basic scene. <br>
maybe one I day I edit this package a little more and have more detailed documentation but for now I believe in you :) <br>
